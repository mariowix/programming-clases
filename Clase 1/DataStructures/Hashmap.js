/* 
Hashing is a fundamental data structure that efficiently stores and retrieves data in a way that allows 
for quick access. It involves mapping data to a specific index in a hash table using a hash function, 
enabling fast retrieval of information based on its key. This method is commonly used in databases, 
aching systems, and various programming applications to optimize search and retrieval operations.
